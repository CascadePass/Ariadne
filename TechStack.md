Why WPF Over Avalonia for Trees & Data Grids?
Superior Data Grid Controls – WPF has the DataGrid control, which supports sorting, filtering, virtualization, and easy customization. Avalonia’s equivalent isn't as polished.

TreeView with Powerful Binding – WPF’s TreeView supports hierarchical templates, virtualization, and seamless MVVM integration—Avalonia’s TreeView is more basic.

Third-Party Libraries – WPF has Telerik, DevExpress, Syncfusion, and other UI libraries offering rich, optimized grids and tree controls.

Better Windows Integration – Since SQL Server is primarily used on Windows, WPF ensures native performance and seamless interaction with SQL-related Windows APIs.
